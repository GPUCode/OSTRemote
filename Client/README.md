# OSTRemote Client

HCTSW (Hikari Calyx Tech SoftWare) Care has gradually disposed NTool for many reasons. As a part of OSTRemote project, we're going to make OSTRemote Client to open source.

## HCTSW Care UU2

This is the new bootloader unlock utility used by HCTSW Care.
Unlike HCTSW Care UU1, UU2 remains open source for those who're still worrying about the tools safety.
