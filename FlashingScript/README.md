# FlashingScript

Before OSTRemote project can become online, this might be the simple but working method to flash "New Sparse" firmware on my website.
Currently the script is written for Windows. ~~Script for macOS and Linux distro coming soon.~~

## about fb2.exe
This is specially made fastboot.exe included in OST LA, it will indicate your projectcode correctly.

## about what you need for payload.bin / unpacked payload flashing ability

For Windows, in my case you'll need these files:


img2simg.exe and required DLLs, in my case:

cyggcc_s-1.dll, cygwin1.dll, cygz.dll


And you'll need to install Python 3.

Hopefully this can be brought to macOS / Linux soon.
